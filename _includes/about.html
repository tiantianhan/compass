My undergraduate degree is in Engineering Science, majoring in Electrical and
Computer Engineering; I graduated from the University of Toronto, Canada. I worked
at ModiFace, Inc. in Toronto for a year as a full-time Android developer helping to make AR
makeup applications, and I interned at MIT for one summer as a visiting student
to help research on energy harvesters.

I got my master's degree at the Entertainment Technology Center, Carnegie Mellon University,
where I learned to to work with creative people and make amazing experiences that I would never otherwise get the chance to do.



As hobbies, I'm currently writing a ray-tracer from scratch and improving my digital painting skills.

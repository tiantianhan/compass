<p><em>Here I am! After a very convoluted series of AirBnb hopping, and with much self-consciousness, I have moved to the States for the next two years to study at the ETC at CMU. Below are some random thoughts to tide over the anxiety before the school year begins…</em></p>

<p>I remember clearly I read this in a gushing review of the work of singer/song-writer <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/3z6Gk257P9jNcZbBXJNX5i">Regina Spektor</a>, though I can’t find the original comment now. The gist of the comment was that Spektor’s music may well be strange sometimes, but it never failed to “transport” you.</p>

<p>Something about that phrase - <em>transported</em> - rang true to me, and I felt I immediately understood what the commenter was trying to describe. To be transported is the sensation of having your attention caught, of being totally absorbed in the experience that the artist is presenting to you.I think, because you are so focused, your awareness so heightened, a moment in an experience like that can feel more immediate and “real” than the real world.</p>

<p>I believe that any project great or small, its goals lofty or modest, can give audiences or users those glimmering moments, moments they will remember after forgetting everything else. I think it would be amazing to play a part in making something like that.</p>
